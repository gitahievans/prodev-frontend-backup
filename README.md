## Our  API Documentation
[Storage-Center]()
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- React Js v18.2.0
- Ruby: 2.7.4
- Rails: 7.0.4
- Postgres: >=15.0


## Setup

### For the backend

- Clone the repository

 ~~~bash
$ git@github.com:gitahievans/store-centre-backend.git
$ cd storage-center-backend
~~~

Install gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

> make sure you have postgress sql installed and running on your system

```
    rails db:migrate
    rails db:seed
```

### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server 
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.



#### For the Frontend

 - Clone the Repo 

 ~~~bash
$ git@github.com:Ezra-code/storage-center-frontend.git
$ cd storage-center-frontend
~~~


- To  Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder Run 
~~~bash
  npm install
~~~

- When done, to start the server run
~~~bash
npm start
~~~

- The app will run in `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser



### Deploy to a live server

 We will deploy using heroku
> To install heroku:-

Step 1: Install Heroku CLI in your system by running the following command. It will install the updated version of Heroku CLI into your system.

~~~bash
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
~~~

To check the version you may run the command.

~~~bash
heroku -v 
~~~

- Step 2: Now, get to https://www.heroku.com/ and register. After completing your registration go to the dashboard and create a new app named ‚Äúmyherokuapp‚Äù or name of your choice. 

- Step 3: Run the following command, it will prompt you to enter any key to continue, it will open a new tab in your browser asking you to log in to your Heroku account. After you enter the required credentials and login on to the site, it is going to show in your terminal ‚ÄúLogged in‚Äù

~~~bash
heroku login
~~~


- Step 4: Initialize a Git repository by running the following command. Make sure you be at the top level of your project directory.

~~~bash
git init
~~~
- Step 5: Now, add the Heroku remote by simply running the command which you will find in your Heroku Dashboard -> myherokuapp or Your App Name -> Deploy Section 

Or 

> Simply run the following command. The deployment method should‚Äôve chosen as GitHub.

~~~bash
heroku git:remote -a myherokuapp
~~~

- Step 6: Now the most important part and i.e Heroku provides the buildpack for Python, Node.js-based app, but it doesn‚Äôt provide buildpack for React apps. So we have to add an extra buildpack in the settings section of your frontend Heroku app.


~~~bash
https://buildpack-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/buildpacks/mars/create-react-app.tgz
~~~

    <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200719000910/buildpack.png" />
    </a>
</div>


Deploying to a live server like Heroku is easy, make sure you have the necessary credentials setup on your local machine for yor local machine



```bash
    heroku create
    heroku rename app-new-name
    git push heroku $BRANCH_NAME:master 
```

if you are already in master branch no need to add $BRANCH_NAME, just use `git push heroku master`

### For the Frontend

~~~bash
  git add.
  git commit -m "First Commit"
  git push heroku master
~~~

### For the backend

```bash
    heroku run rails db:migrate
    heroku run rails db:seed
    heroku open
```

Enjoy your newly deployed React App with rails API for the backend
